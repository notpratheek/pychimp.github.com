                    <article>
                        Hello, My name is Pratheek, and I'm a student.

                        Before venturing into Python, I learnt Java in school, so I have a 
                        fair bit of experience in coding Java. The main motivation behind changing to 
                        Python from Java is that, I did have a (relatively) hard time picking it, but eventually 
                        managed to pick it up. And also, that I wanted to learn a learn a language that 
                        didn't have a syntax similar to C/C++. 
                        
                        Coming to HTML, This was actually a sort of challenge given by friends. 
                        They wanted to create a website that showed troll pictures (something like <a href="http://xkcd.com">XKCD</a>)
                        
                        Before that, I learnt C, but that's all forgotten !
                        
                        Nowadays, aside from studying, I have managed to (finally) learn Vim and use it, and have<
                        also created some colorschemes for Vim. You can check them out here <a href="https://github.com/Pychimp/Pychimp-vim">Colorscheme Repo</a>
                    </article>

                <h2>Why this Name !</h2>
                    <article>
                        So, you must be wondering what kinda of name is that, Pychimp ?
                        Well I was actually watching Nat Geo one day. The show was actually called Mega Factories. And, some time
                        later the show changed, I forgot what the name of the show was about, but it talked the reduction in the
                        popualtion of Chimpanzees in Africa. 
                        
                        At that time, I was writing a Colorscheme for Vim, and wanted to save it in github (as I had seen that 
                        most number of scripts hosted in <a href="vim.org">Vim.org</a>, shifted to Github, since, they could easily
                        update maintain their scritps)
                        
                        So I thought why not? and So, I shifted to Github. And when it asked for a username,
                        I wanted to show my support for the Chimpanzees, and so a simple Chimp, would sound to dumb,
                        So I added Python file extension as a suffix to it ! :)
                        
                        And, Hence, I came up with this name of Pychimp !
