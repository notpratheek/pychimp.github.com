Hello Folks !

This site will host lessons on coding Python. More specifically Python3 

I was inspired by this post by mojombo (Tom Preston-Werner, creator of GitHub !)

http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html

So, I thought, instead of hosting a blog, I wanted to host more of static 
webpages with lessons on coding Python. I will also write some things about my self ! :)

Anyway, got to add some lessons ! 

Bye for now ! :D
